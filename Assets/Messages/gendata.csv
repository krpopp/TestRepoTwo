#17h46.6m,-28.94,2,Dear -----;

You are receiving this email because we are currently in a romantic/sexual relationship.

I have very much enjoyed our correspondence thus far. However; I recently contracted a third-party analysis of our chemistry and I believe it is best that we discontinue contact. Please see data visualizations attached. 

You’ll note that the chemical composition of our sex sessions is severaly lacking oxytocin on both our parts. While there is a clear peak during orgasm; the curve is rather sharp. I would prefer a sexual map with a more stable sine wave.  

Best Wishes;

#7h9.2m,-28.29,7,Here’s the pitch so; let me know what you think:

On MegaPlant NEW MOON society is in CRISIS. After decades under the leadership of PRESIDENT LAMBDA; discontent is at an all time high and the people live in squalor. From MINING GUILD comes the people’s hero: DOMINO. DOMINO; the descendant of a long line of miners; shoulders the burden of advocating for their guild. In time; DOMINO comes head-to-head with PRESIDENT LAMBDA in a match of social wits. 

That’s where I’m at so far. I’m not sure how to end it and the presentation is tomorrow; so I’d 
appreciate your feedback. Thanks!
