17h3.45m,+3,10,Dear Archivist;

Soooo; how do you feel about your new job title? I felt excited even typing it. (I’m looking forward to signing this message with mine! It’s like we’re actually adults now or something.) 

As for me; I’m the assigned Poet to EUS Mariana. Ugh; I was going to reveal my position at the end but I’m too excited!

It’s a lifetime appointment; meaning I’ll be on this exploration vessel until I die. It all sounds very dramatic! But I guess drama is my job now; given I’m an actual Poet. 

You’ve told me a million times that personal messages may never reach you on your outpost; but I figure it can’t hurt to try! If you do see this; know I miss you every day.

(Or whatever passes for a day in space.)

Much love;
Poet  

#9h39.4m,+5.48,10, Dearest Archivist;

I met my crew and I suppose you’ll be happy to hear that you don’t hold a candle to them. Like; they’re nice; but they also feel distant. Maybe I expected a warm welcome? 

The Doctor is especially grumpy. I had a full physical before and after boarding and he was just soooo unpleasant the entire time. Really cold and; like; aren’t doctors supposed to be kind? Helpful? He’s the second youngest; after me; but still a couple decades my senior. 

Anyway; this is what I wrote to commemorate the 43rd crew of the EUS Mariana:
Twelve souls;
all told;
greet the day anew.
Point to point;
rays cast afar;
in search of what is true!

Love;
Poet
 
#93h2.2m,-3.42,10, Dear Archivist; 

The crew doesn’t really seem to be excited about my ballads. I’ve dutifully written something new for every mission so far; but it just feels like paper pushing! I write; read the poem to the crew; I get a few solemn nods or pats on the pack and then… that’s it! I submit it for archival. (Sidenote: I get a thrill thinking maybe you’re the one relaying my poem.)

After so many new experiences I want to revel in my memories. I want to put what I saw and heard into words. I always used to get such a thrill out of writing; but when my only audience is so very dull it takes all the joy out.

Ah well… Here’s a sneak peek at something I’m working on:
Stomach full of nothing;
The growing; void beast.

People like fleas;
Biting and digging;
Until swollen stars remain.

Love;
Poet
 
#1h4.5m,+62.1,10, Archivist;

Take a look at this:
Slow step in the swamp;
Land fallow;
In water shallow.

Cut path through the miasma;
Thick fetor;
In ill weather.

Searching like a root to water;
Growing like a stem to light.

Where water begins and air ends;
I breathe only what I drink.

I wrote this after a frightful recon tour through a swamp. After I read it out to the crew; I got the usual response (nods; back pats; mumbling; etc. etc.).

It was later that day; though; that the Gardener took me aside. She said she loved it! Maybe she’s really into nature metaphor? 

We’ve really connected; though; so I have been feeling a bit less lonely recently. She also told me folks are often distant with new crew members. You have to understand; I’ve replaced a once beloved Poet. It’s hard to adjust to the new face. She said it reminds her of her mortality.

I don’t want to think about stuff like that.

Love;
Poet
 
#9h4.5m,+47.05,10, Dear Archivist;

The Steersman passed away. We’re making a short detour to decommission their body.

She was an older woman; clearly had been a part of the crew for decades and decades. I never really got the chance to know her.

Evidently; we take the dead to intake units. Their ashes and effects are returned to the closest relatives. But I’m not sure if anyone has close relatives? No one talks about it. I imagine if they do have family it’s painful to remember they’ll never see them again. Or maybe everyone’s like us and doesn’t really have anyone?

Well; I do have you; of course.

Love;
Poet
 
#2h8.62m,+9.4,10, Archivist;

This one got a tear out of the Doctor:
Lead on; lead on;
To distant lands;
And deep cores.

Lead on; lead on;
Through empty void;
And open doors.

Lead on; lead on;
West; East;
South; North

Lead on; lead on;
In our hearts;
We go forth.

It’s meant to go with a tune; but I think the lyrics sing for themselves.

With Love;
Poet
 
#7h0.18m,-2.38,10, Dear Archivist;

We picked up our new Steersman today! I had hoped it’d be someone from back home; but alas they may as well be from the other side of the galaxy.

Of course as a Poet I am obligated to write a little something to commemorate the occasion. It’s hard to write about someone you don’t really know. 

Love;
Poet
 
#13h3.38m,-41.21,10, Archivist;

When do you go from something small;
And heavy with purpose;
To something large;
And light with what is done?

Where do you choose some direction;
And tick upon your path;
To beat forever;
And not to be unwound?

-Poet
 
#5h29.1m,+33.3,10, My Archivist;

There’s an archivery near our next fuel stop!!! I’m going to visit it so maybe I can get an idea of what your life is like. It’ll be educational.

-Your Poet
 
#6h0.98m,+8.75,10, Archivist;

I feel ridiculous.

You know how I get too invested in my own ideas. I had to remind myself over and over that the chances of you being at the archivery was a long shot. Somewhere inside; though; I held hope.

I got leave to visit the archivery and it’s just… it’s a box. Like; in the middle of nowhen on some planet that barely warranted an outpost. The archivery was kilometers and kilometers away from the main settlement. 

And the Archivist was some person! I felt like I was choking when I saw this stranger; my throat seized up and I couldn’t breathe. Worst of all; they looked sad for me; like they knew you weren’t the person I was looking for. But you’re the only person who understands me and I don’t even know if I’ll ever see you again. 

-Poet
 
#6h3.39m,+13.2,10, A;

I resent you for not responding.

I know you can't. I saw the equipment in the archivery. After I pulled myself together; the Archivist gave me a tour of the building - the box - and everything had to be centuries old. 

They said the entire system was disconnected from any network. Most of the machines were analog; even. So much hardware like storage and a bunch of flashing lights and other nonsense. I think I heard actual whirring noises. 

And here I am; writing letters; sending them out there and you’re... what? You’re living some ascetic life? Reading someone else’s random crap; saving it for “future generations”?

Hell; I don’t even know if you’re reading this. Why am I writing it?

-P
 
#25h3.33m,+36.7,10, A;

Births and;
Births and;
Births and.

A point then line;
Make a ray.

Years and;
Years and;
Years and.

Take time and space;
Make a life.

Death.

-P
 
#27h6.5m,-23.81,10, A;

It’s my 50th birthday today. That means it was your 51st birthday six months ago. 

It’s late. Hours past lights out. In my ideal world; you’re sitting at your console; reading this message. Maybe years and years later; but still. 

So much has changed about me that I don’t even think I’m a person you’d know. I couldn’t even write it all out.

-P
 
#5h1.24m,+18.3,10, A;

The Doctor died yesterday. From old age. Quietly. In his sleep. The Mariner noticed she couldn’t smell coffee wafting from the mess one morning; so we went to his bunk. And there he was: dead.

That means I’m the last crew member remaining from my original team. 

I like the crew now well enough; don’t get me wrong. We get along really well; actually. But you forget how time passes out here… or that it passes at all. When I joined up; I never really thought about whose shoes I was filling. It was an excuse to leave home; right? 

But there was a Poet before me. Another body slept in my bunk and was; briefly; dead in it. My first team might’ve loved them or hated them or had any sort of relationship with them. 

Do you think about the Archivists who will come after you?

-P
 
#3h7.65m,+52.94,10, My Archivist;

I grasp your hand in mine;
At the edge of our time;
Together.

Two truths transpire;
Opposites; ice and fire;
At once.

First is the braiding of fingers;
The way your grip lingers;
In mine.

Second is the burst;
In my heart; 
In my gut;
In my mind;
And the memory;
Of all the other times.

With Love;
Your Poet
